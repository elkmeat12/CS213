                <span class="dru">Desert Ridge University</span> 
                is a public institution that was founded in 2015 in St. George, Utah. We have a total undergraduate enrollment of 6, 870, 
                its setting is rural, and the campus is 135 acres. It utilizes a semester-based academic calendar, which extends to 17 
                weeks each semester. Being surrounded by many scenic and tourist areas, we believe that students should be learning and 
                applying their knowledge outside of the classroom. Because of this belief, students only spend 1-2 days inside a classroom 
                setting and then the rest of the week at scenic areas such as Zion's National Park, the Grand Canyon, and several others. 
                Destinations are determined according to each student's aligned major.
            </p>

                offers up to 10 degrees, 7 of which are at a bachelor level. Students who love the outdoors and are interested
                in pursuing a career that involves getting their hands dirty, would be a great addition to the Coyote Pack!
