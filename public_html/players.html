                            Julian Francis Edelman (born May 22, 1986) is an American football 
                            wide receiver and punt returner for the New England Patriots of the 
                            National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Kent 
                            State and the College of San Mateo as a quarterback, and was drafted 
                            by the Patriots in the seventh round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He won 
                            Super Bowl XLIX and Super Bowl LI with the Patriots. Edelman primarily 
                            plays in in the slot on offense, and has also been pressed into service 
                            as a cornerback at times when the Patriots have been shorthanded on defense. 
                            He was sidelined with an ACL injury for the entire 2017 season.

                                    Robert Gronkowski (born May 14, 1989) is an American football tight end 
                                    for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). The 
                                    Patriots drafted Gronkowski in the second round of the 2010 NFL Draft 
                                    with the 42nd pick. In his first six seasons, he had 
                                    68 receiving touchdowns (one shy of his favorite number); only two tight 
                                    ends in NFL history have had more in their entire careers. He has achieved 
                                    five Pro Bowl selections and five All-Pro selections, and was a starter in 
                                    the Patriots' Super Bowl XLIX victory. Gronkowski is frequently referred to 
                                    by his nickname "Gronk", derived from his last name.
