                            The main aims of an adventure education degree are to equip students with in-depth environmental 
                            knowledge and encourage personal development while also teaching outdoor and extreme sports-related 
                            proficiencies. Students could be sent climbing rock faces, white water rafting, skiing down mountains 
                            or diving underwater, to name but a few potential activities. The employment possibilities arising 
                            from an adventure education degree are exciting and varied, with jobs ranging from wilderness therapy 
                            leaders to snowboarding instructors to park rangers.

                        According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), animal care workers who care for animals typically have 
                        a degree in animal science. Animal care or animal service workers are employed by local zoos, farms or non-profit 
                        organizations. The beauty of an animal science degree is that the student can focus on hands-on aspects of animal 
                        science, such as animal nutrition or animal biology. For students who want to focus on abstract aspects of animal 
                        science, they can focus on biochemistry, microbiology or genetics. However, many students with animal science 
                        degrees actually work for farming companies. They would focus on things like dairy farming, animal management or 
                        animal breeding. Regardless of the program specialization, the student will learn all about animal behavior and 
                        physiology.

                        Any student who is a nature lover will enjoy getting a degree in environmental science. These professionals 
                        apply their knowledge of the natural sciences to protect and preserve both human and the environment’s health. 
                        A bachelor’s degree in environmental science will normally take an integrated approach to the natural sciences. 
                        Therefore, students will take courses in subjects such as chemistry, biology, geology, and even physics. However, 
                        students can also minor in certain subjects, such as hydrology, waste management, and agricultural engineering. 
                        For students who prefer the quiet comfort of an office environment, they can minor in public policy or administration. 
                        They should take classes that will teach them about the creation and regulation of environmental policies. Students 
                        who wish to pursue a clinical career should focus on fundamental research courses, such as chemistry engineering, 
                        microbiology and advanced genetics.

                        Making a career out of spending time in some of the world’s most beautiful forests is certainly an appealing prospect – and 
                        it’s just one possible outcome of a B.S. in forestry from Desert Ridge University in St. George. Make no mistake about it, 
                        though: this won’t be a walk in the park. Field studies are conducted in the nearby Zion’s National Park – which is just 
                        northeast of St. George. Certificate courses also include wildlife and fire ecology. Here a number of career paths open up 
                        to graduates, among them professional forestry, private consultancy, and opportunities within the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

                        On a career path to becoming a cartographer, an environmental engineer or a landscape architect, geography students must 
                        do far more than just look at things on a map: they’re quite likely to have to get out there and experience all of nature’s 
                        overgrown, wet and wild glory. One good reason to choose a geography degree course carefully is that fieldwork is liable to 
                        be conducted in the university’s surrounding area.

                        Desert Ridge bring students into direct contact with all sorts of aquatic organisms. DRU students may wade through a nearby 
                        mudflat for clams and worms, while their Southwestern counterparts can brave the seas on research boats big and small to 
                        collect samples and data from the ocean or close to the shore. Marine laboratories at both locations offer further scope 
                        for hands-on experience with diverse sea creatures. And if students are able to cope with the conditions, then upon graduating 
                        they can look forward to future employment positions such as coral reef biologist or fisheries observer.

                        students. Focuses include biochemistry, genetics and physiology, and there is plenty of hands-on lab work as well as a 
                        chance to study the area surrounding the university’s Bodega Marine Laboratory. This dedicated facility sits on coastal 
                        land that is rich with a variety of plant and animal specimens, and as many as 500 undergraduate students a year research 
                        the protected habitat in the field. Future career opportunities here are exciting and diverse, potentially taking graduates 
                        into areas such as plant reproduction, forestry, biotechnology or ecological defense.

                        Wildlife conservation enforcement officers, or game wardens, are professionals who are both wildlife advocates and law 
                        enforcement personnel. Therefore, they must have a solid understanding of state and federal wildlife and environmental 
                        laws. Luckily, degree programs offer excellent specialization variety, such as wildlife ecology, biology and conservation. 
                        Additionally, there are degrees for fish and wildlife management and environmental sciences. Typical program courses will 
                        include classes about native plants, wildlife fire management and how to properly sample and measure specimens. Students 
                        who wish to pursue a law enforcement career will take law, communication and self-defense courses. Most wildlife conservation 
                        officers work for the State Police or the U.S. Forest Service.
